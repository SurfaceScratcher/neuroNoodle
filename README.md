# neuroNoodle
An opensource platform, by and for neurodivergent people. 

## The Idea
An opensource software platform that meets the needs of us neurodivergent people - because it comes from us. 

Of course, there are already lots of apps that focus on different aspects, but most of them are fee-based, limited to apple or android or cannot be combined with other tools. The idea is to solve this problem with a platform where we can fulfill our needs together through extensions. 

* free and opensource
* barrier-free
* platform independent
* expandable through plugins
* selfhosting or cloud-based 
* community driven

## How far have we come so far? 
At the moment there is just the idea and i am looking for interested, neurodivergent people who wants contribute. 

## Whats next? 
The first milestone to achieve is to find enough contributors to create a more detailed concept for the launch of the entire project and community.
